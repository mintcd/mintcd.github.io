            a) Trying to classify topics as Constrainers: economics, politics, human rights, etc. since our thoughts are limited by them, or Liberators: philosophy (not the philosophy of politics, of course), language (including formal language theory), mathematics, computer science (maybe), construction (like constructive mathematics), optimization etc. since we can think outside the box through these subjects i.e. they have their own meta-problems. Whatâ€™s worth learning are some of the Constrainers.
          </li>
          <li>
            b) But what things are worth doing? Taking photos may not be a Liberator.
          </li>
          <li>
            c) Semantic Philosophy, where we explain some abstract words more clearly. From use cases to ontology. Examples: understanding, consciousness, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            d) Through the simplification in grammar of many languages overtime, we cannot falsify God.
          </li>
          <li>
            e) How good is enough for a world view? To live peacefully throughout one&apos;s life? To escape from mere things?
