To invent more efficient architectures for specific tasks, it seems like the authors begin from a conceptual think i.e. what needs to be indicate, then trying to model it by this framework. For example, CNN comes from the fact that we do not need to see every pixel to classify that image to belong to the &quot;shoes&quot; class. Therefore, let&apos;talk about concepts, then parameterization, then the technical training process.`,
